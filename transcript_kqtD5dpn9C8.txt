This video is a full course for beginners to learn Python. Python is a popular programming language used for web development, data science, and automation.
We start by installing Python from python.org and setting up a code editor like PyCharm or VS Code.
The first program we write is `print("Hello World")`.
Variables are used to store data. Python has different data types like strings, integers, floats, and booleans.
Strings are text. We can use methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.find()`, and `.replace()`.
Arithmetic operations include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
We can get user input using the `input()` function.
Type conversion is important, for example `int()` converts a string to an integer.
If statements allow us to make decisions. `if`, `elif`, and `else` are keywords.
Logical operators `and`, `or`, `not` combine conditions.
Loops allow us to repeat code. `while` loops run as long as a condition is true. `for` loops iterate over a sequence.
Lists are collections of items. We can add items with `.append()`, remove with `.remove()`, and access by index.
Tuples are immutable lists (cannot be changed).
Dictionaries store key-value pairs.
Functions are reusable blocks of code defined with `def`. They can take parameters and return values.
Exception handling with `try` and `except` blocks helps manage errors without crashing the program.
Classes and Objects are the core of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). A class is a blueprint, and an object is an instance.
Inheritance allows a class to use methods from another class.
Modules are files with Python code that can be imported into other files.
This course covers all the basics you need to start programming in Python.
